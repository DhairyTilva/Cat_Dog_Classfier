# üê±üê∂ Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A simple deep learning project that classifies images as **cats** or **dogs** using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`cat-vs-dog-classifier.ipynb`) for model training and evaluation.
- A Streamlit app (`cat_dog_classify.py`) for interactive image classification.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Trained on a binary dataset of cats and dogs.
- Clean and responsive Streamlit UI.
- Image preprocessing and confidence score display.
- Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` image uploads.

---

## üìÅ Files

- `cat-vs-dog-classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing model architecture, training logic, and evaluation.
- `cat_dog_classify.py`: Streamlit app to classify uploaded images.
- `Cat_Dog_Classifier.h5`: Pre-trained model file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the model file **Cat_Dog_Classifier.h5** is in the same directory as the Streamlit app.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Run the Streamlit App:

```bash
streamlit run cat_dog_classify.py
```

## In the browser:
- Upload an image of a cat or dog.
- Click "Classify" to see the prediction and confidence.
